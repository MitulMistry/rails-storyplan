# Rails Storyplan
Storyplan is a narrative development tool being built using Rails to help users plan out stories and connect with others as their projects evolve. It has started out as a CRUD application involving the creation of stories, chapters, and characters, but there is room for greater functionality going forward.

In order to get the application to work, install dependencies, run migrations, then rake db:seed to populate the database. You need to seed, or else there will be no genres or audiences. In order to get OAuth to work, you need a .env file with a secret and application key.
