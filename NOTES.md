**TODO:**
-Switch from Bower to Webpack for front end dependencies
-Overhaul front end - design and implementation
-Write more integration tests
-Change authorizations to use Pundit
-Set up comments for models other than stories - so chapters, characters, stories - using polymorphic associations:

  -Set up new comment forms - form partial
-Set up chapter ordering

**FUTURE FEATURES:**
-Writing environment - storing formatted text
-More fleshed out attributes for models - i.e. age, personality for characters?
-Privacy options for models
-Likes/dislikes, favorites, share options
-Filtering on index pages
